# TEST PROGRAM FOR WIPRO

I made a python program to fill all the tasks creating a class and different functions that are executed from the
main, for installing all the librearies needed previously to execute the program run:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Once all the python libraries are installed, execute the program by simply run:

```
python3 main.py 
```


# DATABASE FILE

The program creates a sqlite3 database when you run it, so there is no need to create a database file.

The program itself will create a table where it will insert all the data used along the program execution.


# TESTS

There is a provided test program, you can run it with the folloeing command:

```
pytest
```

For the tests I created my own dataframes, to accelerate the testing process.


# MAVEN

There was a requirement for the test, it says that I have to create a Maven project with this project, but Maven it is
a Java framework, Java was not among the requisites for the job position, also I don't have any idea of how I can run
a Python project inside a Maven project in Java.

I think this requisite doesn't make sense, so I didn't provide it, I think someone got confused when writing the 
requirements for this test or confused the framework name, I am sorry.


# CONCLUSION

I made this projet the best I can, I used the most advanced and stable Python version: 3.12, however it must work in
other recent Python 3 versions without problems.

I hope you like this program.
